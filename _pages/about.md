I lead a hardware acceleration team at the system department of ByteDance, driving a few hardware-software codesign initiatives to accelerate network, compute, storage, and security services in data centers with programmable hardware. Prior to that, I was an expert engineer and a technical manager in Tencent TEG (Technology and Engineering Group), leading its SmartNIC and cloud network development and planning at the network platform department. Before joining Tencent, I was a senior software engineer and tech lead in Microsoft Azure Networking, working on [SmartNIC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/azure-smartnic/), RDMA and [Catapult FPGA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-catapult/), and a network researcher in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), with a focus on data center networking and hardware acceleration. Many of my engineering efforts have been widely deployed in data centers. 

I am broadly interested in hardware-software co-design for the cloud and AI systems, with a recent focus on high-speed networking, domain-specific networking, and domain-specific architectures. Some of my research works have been published in top-tier networking and system conferences including SIGCOMM, NSDI, and OSDI.  

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer architecture from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), co-advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~_xie?language=en) and Prof. Yingke Xie.  I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
