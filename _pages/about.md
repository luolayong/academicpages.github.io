I am the head of a hardware acceleration team at ByteDance's System Department, overseeing a diverse range of hardware-software co-design initiatives that aim to accelerate networking, compute, storage, and security for the cloud and AI systems. 

Before that, I worked at Tencent as an expert engineer and technical manager in the Technology and Engineering Group (TEG). There, I launched the SmartNIC/DPU project, built the team, and led the cloud network development in the network platform department. 

Prior to joining Tencent, I was a senior software engineer and tech lead in Azure Networking at Microsoft HQ, working as one of the few early core members on innovative projects including [SmartNIC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/azure-smartnic/), RDMA, and [Catapult FPGA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-catapult/).  Before moving to Azure, I conducted research on data center networking and hardware acceleration, as part of the wireless and networking group at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

I earned my Ph.D. in computer architecture from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), co-advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~_xie?language=en) and Prof. Yingke Xie.  I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

I have extensive experience in building and leading hardware acceleration teams that deliver innovative solutions at hyperscalers. My interests lie broadly in hardware-software co-design for the cloud and AI systems, with a recent focus on high-speed networking, AI interconnect networking, and domain-specific accelerators.  My research has been published in top-tier networking and system conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI & OSDI while many of my engineering efforts have been widely deployed in data centers.

If you are interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
